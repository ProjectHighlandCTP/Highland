# Highland (updated 1/12/17)

### Blurb:
This project is created as part of CUNY Tech Prep's second semester where participants are free to pursue whatever project they wish. In our case, me (Henry He) and Gregory Syzmanski teamed up and worked on Project Highland. It was inspired by Greg's work experience with BQE Wine & Liquor, and although it had excellent service and a huge assortment of booze, the site really could use some work. Highland became a reimagining of the BQE Wine & Liquor site and tried to implement a functional backend. 

### Quick Run through of the Tech Stack:
* **Node** and **Express** for quick setup.
* **EJS** (Embedded Javascript) for templating purposes. I liked using because it wasn't so far removed from your usual HTML syntax. Apparently, it's been replaced with DoneJS.
* **PHP** for the backend, at least until one of us could figure out how to use Javascript in its place.

### Misc. Details
* The web app should work with node versions 6.7 or above.
* Apparently, me and Greg are the only ones to stick together after the participants complete their first project in CUNY Tech Prep. I think that's a good sign of a working relationship (or co-dependence, if you want to go there...)!
